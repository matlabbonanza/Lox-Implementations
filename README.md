# Crafting Interpreters - Java Implementation of Lox
Currently only a repo for me to stash my files that I've written following the book Crafting Interpreters, see Reference 1.

## Makefiles
The Makefiles are setup to be able to execute on a Windows system, instead of the assumed UNIX system in the original repo.
The files are currently extremly hacky, but work for the time being.
