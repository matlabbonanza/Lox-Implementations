# Crafting Interpreters - Java Implementation of Lox
Currently only a repo for me to stash my files that I've written following the book Crafting Interpreters, see Reference 1.

## Makefiles
The Makefiles are setup to be able to execute on a Windows system, instead of the assumed UNIX system in the original repo.
The files are currently extremly hacky, but work for the time being.

## Using LOX in REPL
### Java
Make sure that you have a shell that can run scrips (such as the Git Bash shell).  
In the shell, navigate to the folder containing the `jlox` file.  
Then you can run the following command (as an example) `sh jlox`, which should open a REPL like terminal program where you can write code using the Lox syntax.
